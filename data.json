In the dim light, you can see a lab table in front of you, and a counter behind that. On the table in front of you is a large machine. On the counter are all sorts of chemical equipment - vials, beakes, flasks, eyedroppers, and much more. There are two beakers with pieces of metal inside, connected by a wire - some sort of lab setup? To the left of the sink is a fume hood.There is also a large book on the right of the sink. There is a row of cabinets above the counter.\n--\nWhat do you examine?\n--\n<ol>\n<li>The machine on the table</li>\n<li>The cabinets</li>\n<li>The book</li>\n<li>The lab setup</li>\n</ol>",

The entire complex is eerily silent.\n--\nSuddenly, you hear a buzz, and see a swarm of bugs flying toward you. You hurry back into the lab, and the bugs don't seem to follow. When they reach the entrance you carved in the door, the cloud abruptly stops and flies away.\n--\n<img src = \"images/courtyard.jpg\">\n--\nYour bug bites begin to itch, and you notice several of them have begun to swell up.\n--\nWhat would you like to do next?\n--\n<ol>\n<li>Heal the bug bites</li>\n<li>Put on one of the protective suits and go back out</li>\n<li>Check out the statue</li>\n</ol>",
